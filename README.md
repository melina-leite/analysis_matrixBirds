**Title:** Matrix quality determines the strength of habitat loss filtering on bird communities at landscape scales

**Authors:** _Melina de Souza Leite_, Andrea Larissa Boesing, Jean Paul Metzger & Paulo Inácio Prado

**Keywords**: environmental filter, ecological drift, functional traits, trait-environment relationship, community ecology, landscape structure.

**Permits**: Permission for the data collection was obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) under SISBIO number 46697-1.

**Funding**: The dataset from this study comes from the Interface project supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, 2013/23457-6) with additional support from The Rufford Foundation (grant number 14223-1).

# Analysis

To follow the analysis, please, open the .hmtl files from 0 to 4 in the main folder OR open and run the original .Rmd files in the **scripts** folder.


# Suplementary manterial/information/appendices

The supplementary material/appendices files that accompany the mansucript are in pdf form in the folder **appendices_suppInfo**. The pdfs were built from the script .Rmd files, except for Apppendix 1 which is a .docx file.
